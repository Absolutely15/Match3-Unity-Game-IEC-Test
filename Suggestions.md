Pros: We can achieve better performance by using some helpful tips like:
+ Cached variable.
+ Convert for to foreach when it's possible, limit the use of linq.
+ Use TextMeshPro instead of Text.
+ Remove redundant directive to boost IDE performance.
+ Some code can be refactored to be neater like early return in if-else condition.
+ Use ObjectPool to active/deactive game object instead of instantiase/destroy.
Cons: Some variable don't follow coding convention.
